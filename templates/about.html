        <p>
            CYBERHUB is a curated digital arcade, a beacon for those who revel in the glow of neon and the hum of archaic processors. We aim to provide a seamless, immersive gateway to a collection of games that capture the essence of the cyberpunk genre. This is more than just a website; it's an experience, a dive into dystopian futures where technology and rebellion collide.

        <h2>The Cyberpunk Aesthetic</h2>
        <p>
            Our design philosophy is deeply rooted in the cyberpunk ethos: high-tech, low-life. Expect a visual tapestry woven from dark, moody palettes, vibrant neon accents, and typography that echoes the digital frontier. Every element is crafted to transport you to sprawling megacities and underground havens.
